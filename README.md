## Key Components

- **`ActivityForm`**: Form for adding new activities with validation
- **`MetricsCards`**: Summary cards showing key cost metrics
- **`ActivityTable`**: Sortable table of all activities
- **`CostBreakdownChart`**: Bar and pie charts for cost visualization
- **`ROICalculator`**: Interactive ROI analysis tool

## Calculations

The app uses the following formulas:

### Cost Calculations
- **Cost per Activity** = Duration (hours) Ã— Hourly Rate
- **Weekly Cost** = (Frequency Ã— Cost per Activity) Ã— conversion factor
- **Monthly Cost** = Weekly Cost Ã— 4.33
- **Annual Cost** = Weekly Cost Ã— 52

### ROI Analysis
- **Annual Savings** = Annual Cost Ã— (Efficiency Improvement %)
- **ROI** = ((Annual Savings - Automation Cost) Ã· Automation Cost) Ã— 100
- **Payback Period** = Automation Cost Ã· (Annual Savings Ã· 12) months
